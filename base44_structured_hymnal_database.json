His glories now we sing, Who died, and rose on high, Who died eternal life to bring, and lives that death may die\n\nCrown Him the Lord of peace, Whose power a scepter sways From pole to pole, that wars may cease, Absorbed in prayer and praise. His reign shall know no end, And round His piercèd feet Fair flowers of Paradise extend their fragrance ever sweet.\n\nCrown Him the Lord of Heav'n, One with the Father known And the bless Spirit, thro Him given.

Verse 2 Did we in our own strength confide, Our striving would be losing; Were not the right Man on our side, The Man of God's own choosing: Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is He; Lord Sabaoth, His Name, From age to age the same, And He must win the battle. Verse 3 And though this world, with devils filled, Should threaten to undo us, We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us: The Prince of Darkness grim, We tremble not for him; His rage we can endure, For lo, his doom is sure, One little word shall fell him. Verse 4 That word above all earthly powers, No thanks to them, abideth; The Spirit and the gifts are ours Through Him Who with us sideth: Let goods and kindred go, This mortal life also; The body they may kill: God's truth abideth still, His kingdom is forever.",

See, a fruitful field is growing, Blessèd fruit of righteousness; And the streams of life are flowing In the lonely wilderness. What a wonderful salvation, Where we always see His face! What a perfect habitation, What a quiet resting place! Blessèd quietness, holy quietness, What assurance in my soul! On the stormy sea, He speaks peace to me, How the billows cease to roll!",

Let us all in Thee inherit; Let us find that second rest. Take away our bent to sinning; Alpha and Omega be; End of faith, as its Beginning, Set our hearts at liberty. Come, Almighty to deliver, Let us all Thy life receive; Suddenly return and never, Never more Thy temples leave. Thee we would Be always blessing, Serve Thee as Thy hosts above, Pray and praise Thee Without ceasing, Glory in Thy perfect love. Finish, then, Thy new creation; Pure and spotless let us be. Let us see Thy great salvation Perfectly restored in Thee; Changed from glory into glory, Till we see the loving face, Till we cast our crowns Before Thee, Lost in wonder, love, and praise.",

Who will leave the world's side? Who will face the foe? Who is on the Lord's side? Who for Him will go? By Thy call of mercy, By Thy grace divine, We are on the Lord's side Saviour, we are Thine! Not for weight of glory, Not for crown and palm, Enter we the army, Raise the warrior psalm; But for love that claimeth Lives for whom He died: He whom Jesus saveth Must be  on His side. By Thy love constraining, By Thy grace divine, We are on the Lord's side Saviour, we are Thine! Jesus, Thou hast bought us, Not with gold or gem, But with Thine own lifeblood, For Thy diadem; With Thy blessing filling Each who comes to Thee, Thou hast made us willing, Thou hast made us free. By Thy grand redemption, By Thy grace divine, We are on the Lord's side Saviour, we are Thine! Fierce may be the conflict, Strong may be the foe, But the King's own army None can overthrow; 'Round His standard ranging, Victory to secure, For His truth unchanging Makes the triumph sure. Joyfully enlisting By Thy grace divine, We are on the Lord's side Saviour, we are Thine!",

Whence are the armies which He leadeth, While of His glory they sing? He is our Lord and Redeemer, Saviour and Monarch divine; They are the stars that forever Bright in His kingdom shall shine. Conquering now and still to conquer, Jesus, Thou Ruler of all, Thrones and their scepters all shall perish, Crowns and their splendour shall fall, Yet shall the armies Thou leadest, Faithful and true to the last, Find in Thy mansions eternal rest, When their warfare is past.

Verse 2 Are you ever burdened with a load of care? Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear? Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly, And you will keep singing as the days go by. Verse 3 So, amid the conflict whether great or small, Do not be disheartened, God is over all; Count your many blessings, angels will attend, Help and comfort give you to your journey's end. Chorus Count your blessings, name them one by one, Count your blessings, see what God hath done! Count your blessings, name them one by one, count your many blessings see what God hath done.",

Give me the Bible, when my heart is broken, When sin and grief have filled my soul with fear; Give me the precious words by Jesus spoken, Hold up faiths lamp to show my Savior near. Give me the Bible, all my steps enlighten, Teach me the danger of these realms below; That lamp of safety oer the gloom shall brighten, That light alone the path of peace can show. Give me the Bible, lamp of life immortal, Hold up that splendor by the open grave; Show me the light from Heavens shining portal, Show me the glory gilding Jordans wave.

While we do His good will, He abides with us still, And with all who will trust and obey. Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies, But His smile quickly drives it away; Not a doubt or a fear, not a sigh or a tear, Can abide while we trust and obey. Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share, But our toil He doth richly repay; Not a grief or a loss, not a frown or a cross, But is blessed if we trust and obey. But we never can prove the delights of His love Until all on the altar we lay; For the favor He shows, for the joy He bestows, Are for them who will trust and obey. Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet. Or we’ll walk by His side in the way. What He says we will do, where He sends we will go; Never fear, only trust and obey. Trust and obey, for there’s no other way To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.",

Perhaps today there are loving words which Jesus would have me speak; There may be now, in the paths of sin, some wand'rer whom I should seek. O Saviour, if Thou wilt be my Guide, though dark and rugged the way, My voice shall echo the message sweet, I'll say what You want me to say. There's surely somewhere a lowly place in earth's harvest fields so wide, Where I may labour through life's short day for Jesus, the Crucified. So, trusting my all unto Thy care, I know Thou always love me! I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere, I'll be what You want me to be. I'll go where You want me to go, dear Lord, O'er mountain, or plain, or sea; I'll say what You want me to say, dear Lord, I'll be what You want me to be.",

Through the whole creation we his works may trace, Every-where behold the wonders of his grace. Tho’ the shadows deepen and the nights appall, Tho’ we may be tasting of life’s bitter gall; Still a deep assurance like a dawn so fair, Comes like golden sunrise showing God is there Bless-ed is the soul who on his God relies, He shall soon be singing gone his mournful sighs, Things that seem to hinder as we onward plod, On-ly help to draw us nearer unto God. O the Joy of serving one we love so well! O the peace of trusting more than tongue can tell! Ever safely sheltered from all fear and harm, Guided every moment by his mighty arm Higher that the mountain, deeper than the sea, Broader than the reaches, of eternity. Countless as the stars that high above us shine, Are his mercies all di-vine.",

How easy when sailing the sea in a calm, To trust in the strength of Jehovah’s great arm, But somehow I find when the waves swamp the boat, It takes some believing to keep things afloat. “I’ll stand to the end,” I have heard the people say, “I’ll fight till I die, and will ne’er run away”, But when by temptation so fiercely as assailed, They left off believing and terribly failed. And others there are full of courage and zeal, Who go to the battle like warriors of steel, But right in the heat of the conflict with sin, Instead of believing they faint and give in. Then let us remember, in running this race, This faith is not feeling and trust is not trace, And when all around us seems dark as night, We’ll keep on believing and win the fight.

Roxan Wince\n\nO we dream of a day that is nearing A day of sweet promise and trust When the captive and long trodden City Of Zio shall wake from the dust; And clothed in her beautiful garments, Shall shake off her burden of pain And the north and the south without money Shall loosen her captives again When the hoped for Messiah of ages Shall bring the bright mansions a-down And shall take as a gift from His Father, Of earth's mighty kningdoms, the crown; When the fierce cruel rulers of nations To Him in submission shall bow And the death-dealing steel of the warrior Be changed for the wicked and plow. When the saints in their rainment of glory Shall sit with the Christ on His throne And shall make to all nations and kindreds The blessings of Abraham known; When then band of the harpers shall praise Him With songs that no other can learn, And the palm-bearing ones give their service Wherever His footsteps may turn. O we dream of a day that is nearing, A day of sweet promise and trust, When earth in her vestment of beauty Shall be the bright of the just; When forgetting the day of our trouble The tears shall be wiped from our face And the mocking, the scorn, and the spoiling Have ne'er in our Canaan a place",
